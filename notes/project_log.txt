Previously:
Restarted project under restart branch. 
Basic movechecking for rook done.
No testing done yet.
Movement done step by step.

It would be worthwile to make a .pgn loader and load a game.
Essentially, this would be a simple game viewer and doesn't require move legality checking.
Is it worth doing? It would be nice to make it fully graphical. I'm currently setting up sfml.
