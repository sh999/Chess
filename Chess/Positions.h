 Summary:
 =======
 Does intelligent positions-related functions, like:
    Parses string of FEN-type notation for setting position of pieces
         See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation#Definition
         e.g. normal starting chess position is given by:
             rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1
    Converts square ID (0-62) to position string (e.g. e2)
 Input:
 =====
    FEN-type string such as 
        rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR
    letters represent piece type (obvious). Numbers are # of empty squares
    '/' separates ranks. Start at 8th rank. Lowercase letters are black pieces
 Comments:
 ========
 I will implement the string of pieces and not the things after 'w', which are extra information
  for a complete game. For now, just parse the string to set a normal table
 I could merge this with Board, but I want the Board to be less intelligent
  and only handle physical pieces and no calculations. The piece algorithms are elsewhere
