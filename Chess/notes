-Working on ppctor branch: taking parsing out of constructor
	Success in taking parsing out into parsePositions()

-Think about doing unit tests after merging with master branch

-Now let's work on basic unit tests
Strategy: in main(), call either test() or game(). Create a test.cpp that has all unit tests.

Example scenario:
	Test name: test_findPiece()
	Goal: Find piece on a square
	Sample run:

	$ ./main test
	Available unit tests:
	1) findPiece()
	Enter a test's number to run it or enter 'all' to run all tests.
	$ 1	
	Running findPiece() test...
	Enter the file that has starting positions:
	$ ./test/startingpos.txt
	Input:
	a2: white pawn
	a2: white pawn
	b8: black knight
	Enter the square you would like to find a piece. 'q' to quit:
	$ a3
	No piece found
	$ a2
	White pawn
	$ a3
	White pawn
	$ b8
	Black knight
	$sdlkf
	Invalid position
	$ q
	Quitting...
